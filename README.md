### Creating New Blog Posts

This will prompt you for:

- Post excerpt (optional)
- Author name (defaults to "Liang")

The script automatically:
- Generates a URL-friendly slug from the title
- Creates the markdown file in `/_posts/`
- Sets up the assets directory in `/public/assets/blog/[slug]/`
- Includes proper front matter with all required fields
- Adds a placeholder README for cover images

### Manual Post Creation

- Blog posts are stored in `/_posts` as Markdown files
- Front matter is used for post metadata (title, date, author, etc.)
- Cover images should be placed in `/public/assets/blog/[slug]/cover.jpg`
