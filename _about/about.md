# About Me - Liang
Hello, I'm Liang, a developer based in Montreal. I bring a unique blend of technical proficiency and aesthetic sensibility to my work, specializing in backend development, workflow automation, and creative image processing.

# Professional Skills and Experience
As a flexible developer, I thrive on challenges and have a deep understanding of underlying logic systems. My technical journey is marked by significant contributions across various domains:

### Backend Development and Automation: 
I specialize in designing and optimizing backend systems, ensuring they are robust and scalable. My work in workflow automation has streamlined processes, significantly improving efficiency and productivity for several projects.
### Creative Solutions in Animation and Imaging: 
With a background in animation, I've applied my skills in rigging for the Disney Jr series, blending artistic insights with technical acumen. This experience has enhanced my ability to create visually appealing and technically sound digital solutions.
### Integration and Customization Projects: 
I have substantial experience in integrating major travel agency ticketing APIs, which involved complex problem-solving and system integration skills. Additionally, I've assisted clients in building customized ERP systems from scratch, tailoring solutions to meet unique business needs and rejuvenating outdated systems to boost their performance and relevance.

# Inspirations from Animation
My love for animation spans a wide range of styles and narratives, reflecting my adaptability and broad creative inspirations. I find comfort and creative fuel in Pixar films like Toy Story and the enchanting worlds of Hayao Miyazaki, such as in My Neighbor Totoro. These films not only provide a sense of healing but also enrich my aesthetic appreciation and narrative skills.

On the flip side, I'm captivated by the quirky and unconventional, such as Cat Soup, Over the Garden Wall, and Smiling Friends. These works push the boundaries of conventional storytelling, inspiring me to think outside the box and bring innovative solutions to my technical work. Additionally, I enjoy animations that excel in visual quality alone, appreciating the sheer artistry of animation without the confines of narrative structure.
